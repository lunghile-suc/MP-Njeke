                <p>“We are a new redeemed nation, the holy nation of God. We were not people, 
                    but now are people of God. We once lost his mercy, however, through his 
                    grace we have received his mercy and kindness. We were once stranded on 
                    the mountains of oblivion, wondering aimlessly in the hills of this earthly life, 
                    having lost our way in the jungle of the world, but through his kindness, he 
                    discovered you and me, and gave us new names. I will be a father to you, and 
                    you shall be my sons and daughters”</p>

                    <p>Precisely the book seeks to advance the understanding and often misconstrued concept of Christianity, 
                        traversing two critical gospel mindsets of inclusivism versus exclusivism. The book is delving into 
                        intricacies and paradoxes of the Christian gospel trying to find equilibrium. Depending on who controls 
                        and directs your mind – could thus determine your Christian fate.</p>
                    <p>This book explains, who we let control our minds- using his past experiences – obviously, he can destroy or 
                        redeem your life – or saves us from apocalyptic quagmire or can contributes to our calamity.</p>

                            rekindle God’s love in you through its different 
                            comprehensive teachings.</p>
                        <p style="color: #671314; font-weight: bold;">- Re-discover the power of love and the fruits of 
                            dedication.</p>
                        <p>The book is designed to push your limits of Christian 
                            understanding -guaranteeing that the time you finish 
                            reading – you should distinguish inter-alia - who the 
                            atheist is, Christian and a Born-Again Christian.</p>
